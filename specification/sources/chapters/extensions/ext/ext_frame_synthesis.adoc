==== Overview

This extension provides support to enable frame synthesis on applications
based on additional application provided data.
Application generated motion vector images and depth images may: be used by
the runtime to do high quality frame extrapolation and reprojection to
synthesize a new frame, providing a smooth experience even when the
application is running below the FPS target.

This extension is designed to be independent of
apiext:XR_KHR_composition_layer_depth, and both may: be enabled and used at
the same time, for different purposes.
The slink:XrFrameSynthesisInfoEXT::pname:depthSubImage may: use depth data
dedicated for frame synthesis, and its resolution may: be lower than
slink:XrCompositionLayerDepthInfoKHR::pname:subImage.
See slink:XrFrameSynthesisConfigViewEXT for the suggested resolution of
pname:depthSubImage.


==== Submit motion vector images and depth images

[open,refpage='XrFrameSynthesisInfoEXT',type='structs',desc='Frame synthesis information structure',xrefs='XrCompositionLayerProjectionView XrCompositionLayerProjection XrCompositionLayerBaseHeader XrFrameEndInfo xrEndFrame']
--
The slink:XrFrameSynthesisInfoEXT structure is defined as:

include::{generated}/api/structs/XrFrameSynthesisInfoEXT.adoc[]

.Member Descriptions
****
* pname:type is the elink:XrStructureType of this structure.
* pname:next is code:NULL or a pointer to the next structure in a structure
  chain.
* pname:layerFlags is a bitmask of elink:XrFrameSynthesisInfoFlagsEXT.
* pname:motionVectorSubImage identifies the motion vector image
  slink:XrSwapchainSubImage to be used for frame synthesis.
* pname:motionVectorScale is an slink:XrVector4f which scales the
  interpretation of the motion vector in pname:motionVectorSubImage.
* pname:motionVectorOffset is an slink:XrVector4f which offsets the
  interpretation of the motion vector in pname:motionVectorSubImage.
* pname:appSpaceDeltaPose is the incremental application-applied transform,
  if any, that affects the view since the previous frame.
  Experiences of artificial locomotion (scripted movement, teleportation,
  etc.) involve the application transforming the whole
  slink:XrCompositionLayerProjection::pname:space from one application space
  pose to another pose between frames, affecting the view by more than the
  tracked movement between frames.
  The pname:appSpaceDeltaPose must: be identity when there is no
  slink:XrCompositionLayerProjection::pname:space transformation in the
  application.
  The slink:XrPosef::pname:position in pname:appSpaceDeltaPose must: be
  relative to the current application
  slink:XrCompositionLayerProjection::pname:space.
* pname:depthSubImage identifies the depth image slink:XrSwapchainSubImage
  to be used for frame synthesis.
* pname:minDepth and pname:maxDepth are the range of depth values in the
  pname:depthSubImage, and must: be in the range of [eq]#[0.0,1.0]#.
  This is akin to min and max values of OpenGL's fname:glDepthRange, but
  with the requirement here that [eq]#maxDepth {geq} minDepth#.
* pname:nearZ is the positive distance in meters of the pname:minDepth value
  in the depth swapchain.
  Applications may: use a pname:nearZ that is greater than pname:farZ to
  indicate depth values are reversed.
  pname:nearZ may: be infinite.
* pname:farZ is the positive distance in meters of the pname:maxDepth value
  in the depth swapchain.
  pname:farZ may: be infinite.
  The runtime must: return error ename:XR_ERROR_VALIDATION_FAILURE if
  pname:nearZ == pname:farZ
****

When submitting motion vector images and depth images along with projection
layers, add an slink:XrFrameSynthesisInfoEXT structure to the
slink:XrCompositionLayerProjectionView::pname:next chain, for each
slink:XrCompositionLayerProjectionView structure in the given layer.

The runtime must: interpret the motion vector data in the
pname:motionVectorSubImage's RGB channels, modified by
pname:motionVectorScale and pname:motionVectorOffset as follows:
[eq]#motionVector = motionVectorSubImage~rgb~ * motionVectorScale~xyz~
{plus} motionVectorOffset~xyz~#.
The components [eq]#motionVectorSubImage~a~#, [eq]#motionVectorScale~w~# and
[eq]#motionVectorOffset~w~# are ignored.

The motion vector represents the movement of a pixel since the
slink:XrFrameEndInfo::displayTime of the previous frame until the
slink:XrFrameEndInfo::displayTime of the current frame.
The runtime may: use this information to extrapolate the rendered frame into
a future frame.

The motion vector must: derived from normalized device coordinate (NDC)
space, which in this context uses Vulkan-style conventions: the NDC range is
defined as [-1, -1, 0] to [1, 1, 1], different from OpenGL's NDC range.
However, the motion vector itself is not constrained to this range; its
values depend on the pixel's movement and may extend beyond the boundaries
of the NDC space.
For example, given that a pixel's NDC in the previous frame is PrevNDC, and
CurrNDC in current frame, and that there is no scale or offset, then the
motion vector value is "[eq]#(CurrNDC - PrevNDC)~xyz~#".

[NOTE]
.Note
====
There are many different ways to generate pname:motionVectorSubImage and
pname:depthSubImage.
For example, the application may render them in a lower resolution dedicated
motion vector pass (see slink:XrFrameSynthesisConfigViewEXT for recommended
resolution), or render them in the main view pass with MRT (Multiple Render
Targets).
It is up to the application to decide the specific approach.
Signed 16 bit float per pixel channel formats are recommended for
pname:motionVectorSubImage.

==== Frame synthesis flags

[open,refpage='XrFrameSynthesisInfoFlagBitsEXT',type='enums',desc='XrFrameSynthesisInfoFlagBitsEXT',xrefs='XrFrameSynthesisInfoFlagsEXT']
--

include::{generated}/api/enums/XrFrameSynthesisInfoFlagBitsEXT.adoc[]

.Flag Descriptions
****
* ename:XR_FRAME_SYNTHESIS_INFO_USE_2D_MOTION_VECTOR_BIT_EXT indicates 2D
  motion vector data is used.
* ename:XR_FRAME_SYNTHESIS_INFO_REQUEST_RELAXED_FRAME_INTERVAL_BIT_EXT
  provides a hint to the runtime that the application prefers additional
  time to render each frame, with the trade-off that more frames would be
  synthesized by the runtime.
  This may be useful for applications that prefer to conserve CPU and GPU
  utilization (e.g. for increased battery life) or to increase the compute
  budget of each frame.
  The runtime may: request frames at any interval, regardless of the value
  of this flag.
****

By default, 3D motion vector data is expected by the runtime, so
[eq]#motionVectorSubImage~rgb~#, [eq]#motionVectorScale~xyz~# and
[eq]#motionVectorOffset~xyz~# are used, as described in
slink:XrFrameSynthesisInfoEXT.

When ename:XR_FRAME_SYNTHESIS_INFO_USE_2D_MOTION_VECTOR_BIT_EXT is enabled
on slink:XrFrameSynthesisInfoEXT pname:layerFlags, the runtime instead
interprets the submitted motion vector image as 2D motion vector data,
representing 2D pixel movement from the previous frame to the current frame.
Pixels values are interpreted as follows for 2D motion vector data:
[eq]#motionVector = motionVectorSubImage~rg~ * motionVectorScale~xy~ {plus}
motionVectorOffset~xy~#.
The components [eq]#motionVectorSubImage~ba~#, [eq]#motionVectorScale~zw~#
and [eq]#motionVectorOffset~zw~# are ignored.
Using 2D instead of 3D motion vector data may: decrease the quality of the
synthesized frames.

==== Get recommended resolution

[open,refpage='XrFrameSynthesisConfigViewEXT',type='structs',desc='Composition Layer Frame Synthesis structure',xrefs='XrViewConfigurationView']
--
The slink:XrFrameSynthesisConfigViewEXT structure is defined as:

include::{generated}/api/structs/XrFrameSynthesisConfigViewEXT.adoc[]

.Member Descriptions
****
* pname:type is the elink:XrStructureType of this structure.
* pname:next is code:NULL or a pointer to the next structure in a structure
  chain.
* pname:recommendedMotionVectorImageRectWidth: recommended motion vector and
  depth image width.
* pname:recommendedMotionVectorImageRectHeight: recommended motion vector
  and depth image height.
****

When this extension is enabled, an application can: pass in an
slink:XrFrameSynthesisConfigViewEXT structure in the
slink:XrViewConfigurationView::pname:next chain when calling
flink:xrEnumerateViewConfigurationViews to acquire information about the
recommended motion vector image resolution.

==== Overview

This extension enables applications to locate the individual body joints
that represent the position of the user.
It enables applications to render the whole body in XR experiences.

==== Inspect system capability

[open,refpage='XrSystemBodyTrackingPropertiesBD',type='structs',desc='System property for body tracking',xrefs='']
--
The slink:XrSystemBodyTrackingPropertiesBD structure is defined as:

include::{generated}/api/structs/XrSystemBodyTrackingPropertiesBD.adoc[]

.Member Descriptions
****
* pname:type is the elink:XrStructureType of this structure.
* pname:next is code:NULL or a pointer to the next structure in a structure
  chain.
* pname:supportsBodyTracking is an basetype:XrBool32, indicating if current
  system is capable of receiving body tracking input.
****

An application can: inspect whether the system is capable of body tracking
by extending the slink:XrSystemProperties with
slink:XrSystemBodyTrackingPropertiesBD structure when calling
flink:xrGetSystemProperties.

If a runtime returns ename:XR_FALSE for pname:supportsBodyTracking, the
runtime must: return ename:XR_ERROR_FEATURE_UNSUPPORTED from
flink:xrCreateBodyTrackerBD.

==== Create a body tracker handle

[open,refpage='XrBodyTrackerBD',type='handles',desc='Represents a tracker for a body joints.']
--
The slink:XrBodyTrackerBD handle represents the resources for body tracking.

include::{generated}/api/handles/XrBodyTrackerBD.adoc[]

This handle can: be used to locate body joints using
flink:xrLocateBodyJointsBD function.

A body tracker provides joint locations that track human body motion.

[open,refpage='xrCreateBodyTrackerBD',type='protos',desc='Create a body joints handle.',xrefs='']
--
The flink:xrCreateBodyTrackerBD function is defined as:

include::{generated}/api/protos/xrCreateBodyTrackerBD.adoc[]

.Parameter Descriptions
****
* pname:session is an slink:XrSession in which the body tracker will be
  active.
* pname:createInfo is the slink:XrBodyTrackerCreateInfoBD used to specify
  the body tracker.
* pname:bodyTracker is the returned slink:XrBodyTrackerBD handle.
****

An application can: create an slink:XrBodyTrackerBD handle using
flink:xrCreateBodyTrackerBD function.

If the system does not support body tracking, the runtime must: return
ename:XR_ERROR_FEATURE_UNSUPPORTED from flink:xrCreateBodyTrackerBD.
In this case, the runtime must: return ename:XR_FALSE for
slink:XrSystemBodyTrackingPropertiesBD::pname:supportsBodyTracking when the
function flink:xrGetSystemProperties is called, so that the application
avoids creating a body tracker.

If an invalid value of slink:XrBodyTrackerCreateInfoBD::pname:jointSet is
passed in pname:createInfo, the runtime must: return
ename:XR_ERROR_VALIDATION_FAILURE.

.Parameter Descriptions
****
* pname:bodyTracker is an slink:XrBodyTrackerBD previously created by

****

flink:xrDestroyBodyTrackerBD function releases the pname:bodyTracker and the
underlying resources when the body tracking experience is over.

==== Locate body joints

[open,refpage='xrLocateBodyJointsBD',type='protos',desc='Locate body joint locations',xrefs='']
--
The flink:xrLocateBodyJointsBD function is defined as:

include::{generated}/api/protos/xrLocateBodyJointsBD.adoc[]

.Parameter Descriptions
****
* pname:bodyTracker is an slink:XrBodyTrackerBD previously created by
  flink:xrCreateBodyTrackerBD.
* pname:locateInfo is a pointer to slink:XrBodyJointsLocateInfoBD describing
  information to locate body joints.
* pname:locations is a pointer to slink:XrBodyJointLocationsBD receiving the
  returned body joint locations.
****

The flink:xrLocateBodyJointsBD function locates an array of body joints
relative to a base space at a given time.

include::{generated}/validity/protos/xrLocateBodyJointsBD.adoc[]
--

[open,refpage='XrBodyJointsLocateInfoBD',type='structs',desc='Describes the information to locate body joints',xrefs='xrLocateBodyJointsBD']
--
The slink:XrBodyJointsLocateInfoBD structure is defined as:

.Member Descriptions
****
* pname:type is the elink:XrStructureType of this structure.
* pname:next is code:NULL or a pointer to the next structure in a structure
  chain.
  No such structures are defined in core OpenXR or this extension.
* pname:baseSpace is an slink:XrSpace within which the returned body joint
  locations will be represented.
* pname:time is an basetype:XrTime at which to locate the body joints.
****

The slink:XrBodyJointsLocateInfoBD structure describes the information to
locate body joints.
Callers should: request a time equal to the predicted display time for the
rendered frame.
The system will employ appropriate modeling to support body tracking at this
time.

include::{generated}/validity/structs/XrBodyJointsLocateInfoBD.adoc[]
--

[open,refpage='XrBodyJointLocationsBD',type='structs',desc='Returns the body joint locations',xrefs='xrLocateBodyJointsBD']
--
The slink:XrBodyJointLocationsBD structure is defined as:

include::{generated}/api/structs/XrBodyJointLocationsBD.adoc[]

.Member Descriptions
****
* pname:type is the elink:XrStructureType of this structure.
* pname:next is code:NULL or a pointer to the next structure in a structure
  chain.
  No such structures are defined in core OpenXR or this extension.
* pname:allJointPosesTracked is an basetype:XrBool32 indicating if all joint
  poses (position and orientation) are valid and tracked
* pname:jointLocationCount is a code:uint32_t describing the count of
  elements in pname:jointLocations array.
* pname:jointLocations is an application-allocated array of
  slink:XrBodyJointLocationBD that will be filled with joint locations.
****

slink:XrBodyJointLocationsBD structure returns the state of the body joint
locations.

The application must: allocate pname:jointLocations with enough elements for
all joints of the chosen joint set, and set pname:jointLocationCount
according.

The runtime must: populate elements of the application-allocated
pname:jointLocations array representing human body motion.

The runtime must: populate the pname:jointLocations array with elements
indexed using the corresponding body joint enumeration (e.g.
elink:XrBodyJointBD).
The index enumeration is determined by the elink:XrBodyJointSetBD value used
when creating the slink:XrBodyTrackerBD.
For example, when the slink:XrBodyTrackerBD is created with
ename:XR_BODY_JOINT_SET_FULL_BODY_JOINTS_BD, the application must: set the
pname:jointLocationCount to dlink:XR_BODY_JOINT_COUNT_BD, allocating at
least that many elements in pname:jointLocations, and the runtime must:
populate the pname:jointLocations array indexed by the elink:XrBodyJointBD
enumeration.

If the value of pname:jointLocationCount does not equal the joint count
value associated with the elink:XrBodyJointSetBD value used when creating
the slink:XrBodyTrackerBD, or if pname:jointLocations is code:NULL, the
runtime must: return ename:XR_ERROR_VALIDATION_FAILURE.

If the returned pname:allJointPosesTracked is true, the runtime must: return
all joint locations with ename:XR_SPACE_LOCATION_POSITION_VALID_BIT,
ename:XR_SPACE_LOCATION_ORIENTATION_VALID_BIT,
ename:XR_SPACE_LOCATION_POSITION_TRACKED_BIT,
ename:XR_SPACE_LOCATION_ORIENTATION_TRACKED_BIT set.

If the returned pname:allJointPosesTracked is false, it indicates that for
some joint(s), the body input is not detected or tracked.

.Member Descriptions
****
* pname:locationFlags is a bitfield, with bit masks defined in
  elink:XrSpaceLocationFlagBits, to indicate which members contain valid
  data.
* pname:pose is an slink:XrPosef defining the position and orientation of
  the origin of a body joint within the reference frame of the corresponding
  slink:XrBodyJointsLocateInfoBD::pname:baseSpace.
****

slink:XrBodyJointLocationBD structure describes the position and orientation
of a body joint.

This extension defines 24 body joints.
The body joints are sorted starting from the ename:XR_BODY_JOINT_PELVIS_BD
and then incrementing in a spiral manner.

include::{generated}/api/enums/XrBodyJointBD.adoc[]

Put body in a T-shape as above.
The backward (+Z) direction is perpendicular to body surface and pointing
towards the back of the body.
The right (+X) direction points to the right side of the body.
The Y direction is perpendicular to the X and Z directions and follows the
right hand rule.
